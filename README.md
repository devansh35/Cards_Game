# Cards_Game
 This project is a Cards game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The 
game allows the player to play against the dealer, with options to shuffle the deck, start a new game, and have the 
dealer or player draw cards. The game displays the scores of both the dealer and player and announces the winner 
at the end of the game.
